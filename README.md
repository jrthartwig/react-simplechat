# React SimpleChat Frontend

This project is a React-based front end migrated from the original simplechat repository. It uses Vite for fast development and includes mocked API stubs for all backend interactions.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Notes
- All API calls are currently mocked. Replace the mock API with real endpoints as the backend is rebuilt.
- Focus on UI and component logic.

## Next Steps
- Build out the chat UI using React components.
- Incrementally replace mock API with FastAPI backend.
